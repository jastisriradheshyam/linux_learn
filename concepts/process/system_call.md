# system call

- A **system call** is a **request** in a **Unix-like operating system** ***by*** an **active process** for a **service performed by the kernel** (i.e., the core of the operating system), such as input/output (I/O) or process creation. [1]
- **System calls** can also be viewed as **clearly-defined**, ***direct*** **entry points** into the **kernel** through which **programs request services** from it. [1]
